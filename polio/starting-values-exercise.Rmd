### Exercise

Think about possible improvements on the assignment of randomized starting values for the parameter estimation searches. Propose and try out a modification of the procedure. Does it make a difference?

### Solution

The starting points are determined by the specification of the region in which they are chosen, and how they are selected within this region.
We have followed a fairly simple and natural choice to make independent uniform draws from a specified box.
`profileDesign()` also supports a pseudo-random Sobol design rather than independent draws.
Whether a specified box has a reasonable extent can be checked by plotting the starting values on a scatterplot with the candidate maximizations obtained, as demonstrated in the [global search example](../mif/mif.html#a-global-search-of-the-likelihood-surface-using-randomized-starting-values) from the [iterated filtering tutorial](../mif/mif.html).

The transformed scale may be more reasonable for selecting uniformly distributed starting values. For example, if we are not sure about the order of magnitude of a non-negative parameter, and we set its box interval to $[0.1,10]$, we likely want to spend half our search effort with initial values in the interval $[0.1,1]$. Sampling unformly on the log scale achieves this. 
We can change our code as follows to implement this for the polio profile calculation.


```{r echo=F}
library(tidyverse)
read_csv("https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/polio/polio_wisconsin.csv",comment="#")  %>% as.data.frame() -> polio_data

initial_births <- set_names(polio_data$births[11:16],c("SB1_0","SB2_0","SB3_0","SB4_0","SB5_0","SB6_0"))

fixed_params <-  c(delta=1/60,initial_births)
est_params <- c(b1=3,b2=0,b3=1.5,b4=6,b5=5,b6=3,psi=0.002,rho=0.01,tau=0.001,sigma_dem=0.04,sigma_env=0.5,SO_0=0.12,IO_0=0.001)

params <- c(est_params,fixed_params)

box <- rbind(c(est_params/2,fixed_params),c(est_params*2,fixed_params))
rownames(box) <- c("min","max")
```

```{r eval=F}
profileDesign(
  rho=seq(0.01,0.025,length=30),
  lower=box["min",],upper=box["max",],
  nprof=10
) -> starts
```

becomes

```{r eval=F}
profileDesign(
  rho=seq(log(0.01),log(0.025),length=30),     
  lower=partrans(polio,box["min",],dir="toEst")[colnames(box)!="rho"],     
  upper=partrans(polio,box["max",],dir="toEst")[colnames(box)!="rho"],
  nprof=10
) -> trans_starts
starts <- data.frame(t(partrans(polio,t(trans_starts),dir="fromEst")))
```

A comparable change was also made for the global search. The results from running the modified version are at [starting-values-exercise/polio.html](starting-values-exercise/polio.html). The maximized log likelihood of -794.6 is not a substantial improvement on the previous value of -794.5, indeed it is a little worse. However, the pairs plot of estimates from the global search does reveal an advantage for the modified scale. The distinct mode with low $\sigma_{\mathrm{env}}$ is better explored with the modified starting value distribution. When making uniform draws on an untransformed scale, very few initial values explore a region where a parameter has small order of magnitude. In this case, the small $\sigma_{\mathrm{env}}$ mode has likelihood around 15 log units short of the maximum so it is not a competitive explanation of the data. However, in some other situation, this shows how transforming the starting value distribution could be useful.
