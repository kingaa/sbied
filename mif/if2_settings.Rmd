## Choosing the algorithmic settings for IF2

+ The initial parameter swarm, $\{ \Theta^0_j, j=1,\dots,J\}$, usually consists of $J$ identical replications of some starting parameter vector.
+ $J$ is set to be sufficient for particle filtering.
  Because the addition of random perturbations acts to combat particle depletion, it is typically possible to take $J$ substantially smaller than the value needed to obtain precise likelihood estimates via `pfilter`.
  By the time of the last iteration ($m=M$) one should not have effective sample size close to 1. 
+ Perturbations are usually chosen to be multivariate normal, with $\sigma_m$ being a scale factor for iteration $m$:
$$h_n(\theta|\varphi;\sigma) \sim N[\varphi, \sigma^2_m V_n].$$
+ $V_n$ is usually taken to be diagonal,
$$ V_n = \left( \begin{array}{ccccc}
v_{1,n}^2 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & v_{2,n}^2 &  0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & v_{3,n}^2 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & v_{p,n}^2 \end{array}\right).$$
+ If $\theta_i$ is a parameter that affects the dynamics or observations throughout the time series, it is called a __regular parameter__, and it is often appropriate to specify $$v_{i,n} = v_i.$$
+ If $\theta_j$ is a parameter that affects only the initial conditions of the dynamic model, it is called an __initial value parameter__ (IVP) and it is appropriate to specify $$v_{j,n} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} v_j & \mbox{if $n=0$} \\0 & \mbox{if $n>0$} \end{array}\right.$$
+ If $\theta_k$ is a break-point parameter that models how the system changes at time $t_q$, then $\theta_k$ is like an IVP at time $t_q$ and it is appropriate to specify $$v_{j,n} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} v_j & \mbox{if $n=q$} \\	0 & \mbox{if $n\neq q$} \end{array}\right.$$
+ $\sigma_{1:M}$ is called a __cooling schedule__, following a thermodynamic analogy popularized by [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing).
  As $\sigma_m$ becomes small, the system cools toward a "freezing point".
  If the algorithm is working successfully, the freezing point should be close to the lowest-energy state of the system, i.e., the MLE.
  Typical choices of the cooling schedule are geometric, $\sigma_m = \alpha^m$, and hyperbolic, $\sigma_m \propto 1/(1+\alpha\,m)$.
  In `mif2`, the cooling schedule is parameterized by $\sigma_{50}$, the cooling fraction after 50 IF2 iterations.
+ It is generally helpful to transform the parameters so that (on the estimation scale) they are real-valued, unconstrained, and have uncertainty on the order of 1 unit.
  For example, one typically takes a logarithmic transformation of positive parameters and a logistic transformation of $[0,1]$ valued parameters.
+ On such a scale, it is surprisingly often effective to take $$v_i \sim 0.02$$ for regular parameters (RPs) and $$v_j \sim 0.1$$ for initial value parameters (IVPs).
+ We suppose that $\sigma_1=1$, since the scale of the parameters is addressed by the matrix $V_n$.
  Early on in an investigation, one might take $M=100$ and $\sigma_M=0.1$.
  As the investigation proceeds, consideration of diagnostic plots may suggest refinements. 
+ It is remarkable that useful general advice exists for the choice of algorithmic parameters that should in principle be model- and data-specific.
  Here is one possible explanation:
  the precision of interest is often the second significant figure and there are often order 100 observations (10 monthly observations would be too few to fit a mechanistic model;
  1000 would be unusual for an epidemiological system).

#### Exercise: Assessing and improving algorithmic parameters

Develop your own heuristics to try to improve the performance of `mif2` in the [Consett measles example](./notes.pdf).
Specifically, for a global optimization procedure carried out using random starting values in the specified box, let
$\hat\Theta_{\mathrm{max}}$ be a random Monte Carlo estimate of the resulting MLE, and let $\hat\theta$ be the true (unknown) MLE.
We can define the maximization error in the log likelihood to be
$$e = \ell(\hat\theta) - E[\ell(\hat\Theta_{\mathrm{max}})].$$
We cannot directly evaluate $e$, since there is also Monte Carlo error in our evaluation of $\ell(\theta)$, but we can compute it up to a known precision.
Plan some code to estimates $e$ for a search procedure using a computational effort of $JM=2\times 10^7$, comparable to that used for each mif computation in the global search.
Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this quantification of optimization success.
See if you can choose $J$ and $M$ subject to this constraint, together with choices of `rw.sd` and the cooling rate, `cooling.fraction.50`, to arrive at a quantifiably better procedure.
Computationally, you may not be readily able to run your full procedure, but you could run a quicker version of it.
