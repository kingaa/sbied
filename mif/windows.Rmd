Some Windows users have reported trouble with the parallel codes in Lesson 4.
Specifically, **pomp** codes that require compilation of C snippets trigger errors when executed in parallel on certain Windows machines.

The workaround is to execute *serially* all codes that require compilation;
that is, to execute them *outside* of all parallel code blocks.

Calls that induce compilation include:

1. Every call to a **pomp** function in which a basic model component is specified using a C snippet.
Recall that the basic model components include `rmeasure`, `dmeasure`, `rprocess`, `dprocess`, `skeleton`, `rprior`, `dprior`, `partrans`, and `rinit`.
Whenever one of these arguments is furnished a `Csnippet`, the snippet is compiled.  
2. Every call to a **pomp** function in which a parameter transformation is specified by giving the names of parameters to log-transform, logit-transform, or log-barycentric transform.
Even though the user does not supply a `Csnippet` in such cases, each such call results in a `Csnippet` being written internally, and then compiled.

In addition, the use of temporary directories to hold the C files and dynamically loadable libraries created from them that underlie the C snippet facility causes problems on certain Windows machines.
We hypothesize that this is due to Windows securities features.

Again, there is a workaround.
One can specify to **pomp** that all compilation should be done in the current working directory.
The easiest way to do this is to give a global option indicating to which directory the C files should be written.
For example, the first of the following commands create a temporary directory under the current working directory (recall that you can execute `getwd()` to find out where that is).
The second command sets a global option, with the effect that every **pomp** compilation operation will be performed in that directory.
```{r cdir,eval=FALSE}
dir.create("tmp")
options(pomp_cdir="./tmp")
```

As an illustration, we will consider two code chunks.
Before we do so, we load some packages, set up a parallel environment, and build the SIR model we have seen in the Lessons.
The latter is stored in an object named `measSIR`.

```{r snip0,message=FALSE,results="hide"}
library(pomp)
library(doParallel)
registerDoParallel()

source("https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/pfilter/model.R")
```

Now compare the following two code chunks.
The first produces an error on most Windows machines:
	
```{r snip1,message=FALSE,results="hide"}
foreach (i=1:4,.combine=c) %dopar% {
  library(pomp)
  measSIR %>%
    mif2(
      Np=1000, Nmif=5,
      cooling.fraction.50=0.5,
      rw.sd=rw.sd(Beta=0.2, rho=0.2, eta=ivp(0.2)),
      partrans=parameter_trans(log="Beta",logit=c("rho","eta")),
      paramnames=c("Beta","rho","eta")
    )
} -> mifs_local
```

The next one does not:

```{r snip2,message=FALSE,results="hide"}
## Compilation is done here (since `partrans` leads to compilation).
measSIR %>%
  pomp(
    partrans=parameter_trans(log="Beta",logit=c("rho","eta")),
    paramnames=c("Beta","rho","eta")
  ) -> measSIR2

## No compilation is triggered inside the parallel code block.
foreach (i=1:4,.combine=c) %dopar% {
  library(pomp)
  measSIR2 %>%
    mif2(
      Np=1000, Nmif=5,
      cooling.fraction.50=0.5,
      rw.sd=rw.sd(Beta=0.2, rho=0.2, eta=ivp(0.2))
    )
} -> mifs_local
```

The only difference between the code chunks is that, in the first, compilation is needed *inside* the parallel code block;
In the second, the compilation is done *before* the parallelization, via the call to `pomp`.
