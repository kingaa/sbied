[**R** codes for this document](./codes.R)  

This document is derived from @King2015 and the [data supplement archived on datadryad.org](https://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.r5f30).

Produced in **R** version `r getRversion()` using **pomp** version `r packageVersion("pomp")`.

------------------------------------


```{r knitr-opts,include=FALSE,purl=FALSE}
source("../setup.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
```

```{r load_chunks,include=FALSE}
read_chunk("codes.R")
```

```{r prelims,include=FALSE}
```

## Objectives

1. To present the **pomp** codes used in the Ebola case study.
1. To enable reproducibility of the case study and re-application of these codes in other situations.

All codes needed to reproduce the results of the original @King2015 paper are available on [datadryad.org](https://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.r5f30).


## Data and model

### Situation-report data

Download the data from the WHO Situation Report of 1 October 2014:

```{r get-data}
```

Supplementing these data are population estimates for the three countries.
These are census figures from 2014.

```{r popsizes}
```

```{r plot-data}
```


### An SEIR model with gamma-distributed latent and infectious periods

Many of the early modeling efforts used variants on the simple SEIR model.
Here, we'll focus on a variant that attempts a more careful description of the duration of the latent period.
Specifically, this model assumes that the amount of time an infection remains latent is
$$\mathrm{LP} \sim \dist{Gamma}{m,\frac{1}{m\,\alpha}},$$
where $m$ is an integer.
This means that the latent period has expectation $1/\alpha$ and variance $1/(m\,\alpha)$.
In this document, we'll fix $m=3$.

We implement Gamma distributions using the so-called *linear chain trick*.

### Process model simulator

```{r rproc}
```


### Deterministic skeleton

The deterministic skeleton is a vectorfield (i.e., a system of ordinary differential equations).
The following C snippet computes the components of this vectorfield as functions of the state variables and parameters.

```{r skel}
```

###  Measurement model: overdispersed count data

$C_t | H_t$ is negative binomial with $\expect{C_t|H_t} = \rho\,H_t$ and $\var{C_t|H_t} = \rho\,H_t\,(1+k\,\rho\,H_t)$.

```{r measmodel}
```

### Pomp construction

The following function constructs a `pomp` object to hold the data for any one of the countries.
It demonstrates one level of abstraction above the basic `pomp` constructor.

```{r pomp-construction}
```
