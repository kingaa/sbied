\subsection{2014 West Africa EVD outbreak}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{An emerging infectious disease outbreak}

  Let's situate ourselves at the beginning of October 2014.
  The WHO situation report contained data on the number of cases in each of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.
  Key questions included:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    How fast will the outbreak unfold?
  \item
    How large will it ultimately prove?
  \item
    What interventions will be most effective?
  \end{enumerate}

  \framebreak
  
  As is to be expected in the case of a fast-moving outbreak of a novel pathogen in an underdeveloped country, the answers to these questions were sought in a context far from ideal:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Case ascertainment is difficult and the case definition itself may be evolving.
  \item
    Surveillance effort is changing on the same timescale as the outbreak itself.
  \item
    The public health and behavioral response to the outbreak is rapidly changing.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Best practices}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \citet{King2015} paper focused critical attention on the economical and therefore common practice of fitting deterministic transmission models to cumulative incidence data.
  \item 
    Specifically, \citet{King2015} showed how this practice easily leads to overconfident prediction that, worryingly, can mask their own presence.
  \item 
    The paper recommended the use of POMP models, for several reasons:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Such models can accommodate a wide range of hypothetical forms.
    \item
      They can be readily fit to incidence data, especially during the exponential growth phase of an outbreak.
    \item
      Stochastic models afford a more explicit treatment of uncertainty.
    \item
      POMP models come with a number of diagnostic approaches built-in, which can be used to assess model misspecification.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section{Data and model}

\subsection{Data}

\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{Situation-report data}

  The data and \pkg{pomp} codes used to represent the transmission models are presented in \link{./model.html}{a supplement}.

  The data we focus on here are from the WHO Situation Report of 1 October 2014.
  Supplementing these data are population estimates for the three countries.

\subsection{Model}

\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{SEIR model with gamma-distributed latent period}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Many of the early modeling efforts used variants on the simple SEIR model.
  \item 
    Here, we'll focus on a variant that attempts a more careful description of the duration of the latent period.
  \item 
    Specifically, this model assumes that the amount of time an infection remains latent is
    \begin{equation*}
      \mathrm{LP} \sim \dist{Gamma}{m,\frac{1}{m\,\alpha}},
    \end{equation*}
    where $m$ is an integer.
  \item 
    This means that the latent period has expectation $1/\alpha$ and variance $1/(m\,\alpha)$. In this document, we'll fix $m=3$.
    \framebreak
  \item 
    We implement Gamma distributions using the so-called \emph{linear chain trick}.
  \end{itemize}

  The observations are modeled as a negative binomial process conditional on the number of infections.
  That is, if $C_t$ are the reported cases at week $t$ and $H_t$ is the true incidence, then we postulate that $C_t | H_t$ is negative binomial with
  \begin{equation*}
    \expect{C_t|H_t} = \rho\,H_t\] and \[\var{C_t|H_t} = \rho\,H_t\,(1+k\,\rho\,H_t).
  \end{equation*}
  The negative binomial process allows for overdispersion in the counts. This overdispersion is controlled by parameter $k$.

\subsection{Parameter estimates}

\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{Parameter estimates}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \citet{King2015} estimated parameters for this model for each country.
  \item 
    A Latin hypercube design was used to initiate a large number of iterated filtering runs.
  \item 
    Profile likelihoods were computed for each country against the parameters $k$ (the measurement model overdispersion) and $R_0$ (the basic reproductive ratio).
  \item 
    Full details are given \link{https://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.r5f30}{on the datadryad.org site}.
  \item 
    Codes for this document are \link{./codes.R}{available here}.
    The results of these calculations are loaded and displayed in the following.

    <<load-profile,echo=FALSE>>=
    @
    
  \item 
    The following are plots of the profile likelihoods.
    The horizontal line represents the critical value of the likelihood ratio test for $p=0.01$.

\section{Model Criticism}

\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{Diagnostics \emph{or} Model Criticism}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Parameter estimation is the process of finding the parameters that are ``best'', in some sense, for a given model, from among the set of those that make sense for that model.
  \item
    Model selection, likewise, aims at identifying the ``best'' model, in some sense, from among a set of candidates.
  \item
    One can do both of these things more or less well, but no matter how carefully they are done, the best of a bad set of models is still bad.
  \item
    Let's investigate the model here, at its maximum-likelihood parameters, to see if we can identify problems.
  \item
    The guiding principle in this is that, if the model is ``good'', then the data are a plausible realization of that model.
  \item
    Therefore, we can compare the data directly against model simulations.
  \item
    Moreover, we can quantify the agreement between simulations and data in any way we like.
  \item
    Any statistic, or set of statistics, that can be applied to the data can also be applied to simulations.
  \item
    Shortcomings of the model should manifest themselves as discrepancies between the model-predicted distribution of such statistics and their value on the data.
  \item
    \pkg{pomp} provides tools to facilitate this process.
  \item
    Specifically, the \code{probe} function applies a set of user-specified summary statistics or \emph{probes}, to the model and the data, and quantifies the degree of disagreement in several ways.
    
  \item 
    Let's see how this is done using the model for the Guinean outbreak.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}  

\subsection{Simulation for diagnosis}

\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{Model simulations}

  From our profile-likelihood calculations, we extract the MLE:

  <<diagnostics1a>>=
  @

  Here, \code{profs} contains the profile-likelihood calculations displayed previously and \code{gin} is a pomp object containing the model and data for Guinea.
  
  \framebreak

  The following generates and plots some simulations on the same axes as the data.

  <<diagnostics1b>>=
  @

\end{frame}

\subsection{Diagnostic probes}
  
\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{Diagnostic probes}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Does the data look like it could have come from the model?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      The simulations appear to be growing a bit more quickly than the data.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Let's try to quantify this.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      First, we'll write a function that estimates the exponential growth rate by linear regression.
    \item
      Then, we'll apply it to the data and to 500 simulations.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    In the following, \code{gin} is a pomp object containing the model and the data from the Guinea outbreak.

    <<diagnostics-growth-rate,out.width="0.7\\textwidth">>=
    @ 
    
  \item
    Do these results bear out our suspicion that the model and data differ
    in terms of growth rate?

    \framebreak
    
    <<diagnostics1b,echo=FALSE>>=
    @

    \framebreak
    
  \item
    The simulations also appear to be more highly variable around the trend
    than do the data.

    <<diagnostics-growth-rate-and-sd,out.width="0.7\\textwidth">>=
    @

  \item
    Do we see evidence for lack of fit of model to data?
    
    \framebreak
    
  \item
    Let's also look more carefully at the distribution of values about the trend using the 1st and 3rd quartiles.
  \item
    Also, it looks like the data are less jagged than the simulations.
    We can quantify this using the autocorrelation function (ACF).

    <<diagnostics2,fig.width=6,fig.height=6,out.width="0.65\\textwidth">>=
    @ 

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Exercise}

\begin{frame}{\myexercise. The Sierra Leone outbreak}

  Apply probes to investigate the extent to which the SEIR model above is an adequate description of the data from the Sierra Leone outbreak.
  Have a look at the probes provided with \pkg{pomp}: \code{?basic.probes}.
  Try also to come up with some informative probes of your own. Discuss the implications of your findings.
\end{frame}

\section{Forecasting using POMP models}

\subsection{Sources of uncertainty}

\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{Forecasting and forecasting uncertainty}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    To this point in the course, we've focused on using POMP models to answer scientific questions,
    i.e., to compare alternative hypothetical explanations for the data in hand.
  \item 
    Of course, we can also use them to make forecasts.

    \framebreak
    
  \item 
    A set of key issues surrounds quantifying the forecast uncertainty.
  \item 
    This arises from four sources:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      measurement error
    \item
      process noise
    \item
      parametric uncertainty
    \item
      structural uncertainty
    \end{enumerate}
  \item    
    Here, we'll explore how we can account for the first three of these in making forecasts for the Sierra Leone outbreak.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Forecasting Ebola: an empirical Bayes approach}

\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{Parameter uncertainty}

  We take an \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method}{\emph{empirical Bayes}} approach.

  First, we set up a collection of parameter vectors in a neighborhood of the maximum likelihood estimate containing the region of high likelihood.

  <<forecasts1a,include=FALSE>>=
  @ 
  
  <<forecasts1c>>=
  @ 
  
  <<forecasts1d,eval=FALSE>>=
  @

  \framebreak

  <<forecasts1d,echo=FALSE,fig.width=7,fig.height=7,out.width="0.65\\textwidth">>=
  @

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{Process noise and measurement error}
      
  Next, we carry out a particle filter at each parameter vector, which gives us estimates of both the likelihood and the filter distribution at that parameter value.
  
  <<forecasts2c,eval=FALSE>>=
  @
    
  \framebreak

  We extract the state variables at the end of the data for use as initial conditions for the forecasts.

  <<forecasts2d,eval=FALSE>>=
  @
  
  The final states are now stored in \code{x}.

  \framebreak

  We simulate forward from the initial condition, up to the desired forecast horizon, to give a forecast corresponding to the selected parameter vector.
  To do this, we first set up a matrix of parameters:
  <<forecasts2e1,eval=FALSE>>=
  @

  \framebreak

  Then, we generate simulations over the ``calibration period'' (i.e., the time interval over which we have data).
  We record the likelihood of the data given the parameter vector:
  <<forecasts2e2,eval=FALSE>>=
  @

  \framebreak

  Now, we create a new pomp object for the forecasting.

  <<forecasts2f,eval=FALSE>>=
  @
  
  \framebreak
  
  We set the initial conditions to the ones determined above and perform forecast simulations.

  <<forecasts2g,eval=FALSE>>=
  @
  
  \framebreak

  We combine the calibration and projection simulations into a single data frame.
  
  <<forecasts2h,eval=FALSE>>=
  @
  
  We repeat this procedure for each parameter vector, binding the results into a single data frame.
  See \link{./codes.R}{this lesson's \Rlanguage script} for details.

  \framebreak
  
  <<get_forecasts,include=FALSE,cache=FALSE>>=
  readRDS("results/forecasts.rds") -> sims
  @ 
  
  We give these prediction distributions weights proportional to the estimated likelihoods of the parameter vectors.

  <<forecasts2j>>=
  @

  We verify that our effective sample size is large.

  <<forecasts2k>>=
  @ 

  \framebreak
  
  Finally, we compute quantiles of the forecast incidence.

  <<forecasts2l>>=
  @ 

  \framebreak
  
  <<forecast-plots,echo=FALSE>>=
  @
  
\end{frame}

\subsection{Exercise}

\begin{frame}{\myexercise. Decomposing the uncertainty}
  As we have discussed, the uncertainty shown in the forecasts above has three sources: parameter uncertainty, process noise, and measurement error.
  Show how you can break the total uncertainty into these three components.
  Produce plots similar to that above showing each of the components.
