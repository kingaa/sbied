## Exercise

What is the difference between a likelihood slice and a profile? What is the consequence of this difference for the statistical interpretation of these plots? How should you decide whether to compute a profile or a slice?

-----------------

## Solution

* A likelihood surface with two parameters can be visualized as a mountain, with the elevation of the mountain at each spatial location corresponding to the value of the likelihood at this coordinate pair of parameters. 

* Suppose we look at the mountain from the south, at a large distance.

    + The profile likelihood is the silhouette of the mountain.

    + The slice of the likelihood through the maximum likelihood estimate is the elevation at an east-west cross-section through the peak of the mountain.

* The profile and the slice could be very different. For example, imagine the situation if the mountain's peak has sheer cliffs to the east and west, but a gradual ridge descending south-east to north-west.

* For a mountain with elliptical contours with axes running north-south and east-west, the slice and profile are the same. This corresponds to the likelihood function for independent Gaussian measurements on two parameters.

* The profile likelihood has useful statistical properties arising from its relationship to likelihood ratio tests and Wilks' theorem. It can therefore be used to construct confidence intervals.

* A slice cannot usually be used to build confidence intervals.

* A slice is much quicker to compute than a profile, since it involves likelihood evaluation along a range of parameter values whereas the profile involves likelihood maximization along this range.

* A slice can be useful as a relatively quick, informal investigation of the likelihood. Profiles may be calculated in a later stage of the analysis, when we are ready to apply all the computational resources at our disposal.

* If only one parameter is being estimated, a slice and a profile are the same thing!
