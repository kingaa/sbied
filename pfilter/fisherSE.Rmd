* Fisher information is a common way to get standard errors in various settings, but is not so suitable for POMP models. 

* We often find ourselves working with complex models having some weakly identified parameters for which the asymptotic assumptions behind these standard errors are inadequate.

* Further, the technique requires evaluation of second derivatives of the log likelihood; a numerically unstable problem when one has the capability to obtain only noisy estimates of the log likelihood.


* We suppose that $\theta\in\R^D$ and so we can write $\theta=\theta_{1:D}$.

* The [Hessian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix) of a function is the matrix of its second partial derivatives. We write the Hessian matrix of the log likelihood function as $\nabla^2\loglik(\theta)$, a $D\times D$ matrix whose $(i,j)$ element is
$$ \big[\nabla^2\loglik(\theta)\big]_{ij} =  \frac{\partial^2}{\partial\theta_i\partial\theta_j}\loglik(\theta).$$

* The observed Fisher information is
$$ \data{I} = - \nabla^2\loglik(\data{\theta}).$$

* A standard asymptotic approximation to the distribution of the MLE for large $N$ is
$$ \hat\theta(Y_{1:N}) \approx N[\theta, {\data{I}}^{-1}],$$
where $\theta$ is the true parameter value.
This asserts that the MLE is asymptotically unbiased, with variance asymptotically attaining the Cramer-Rao lower bound. Thus, we say the MLE is **asymptotically efficient**.

* A corresponding approximate 95% confidence interval for $\theta_d$ is
$$ \data{\theta_d} \pm 1.96 \big[{\data{I}}^{-1}\big]_{dd}^{1/2}.$$

* We usually only have one time series, with some fixed $N$, and so we cannot in practice take $N\to\infty$. When our time series model is non-stationary it may not even be clear what it would mean to take $N\to\infty$. These asymptotic results should be viewed as nice mathematical reasons to consider computing an MLE, but not a substitute for checking how the MLE behaves for our model and data.
