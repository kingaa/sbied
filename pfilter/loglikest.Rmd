## Problem statement

Desiderata for Monte Carlo log likelihood approximation include:

- Low Monte Carlo bias and variance
- Estimates of the bias and variance so that we know the extent of Monte Carlo uncertainty in our results
- Rapid computation

Set up a likelihood evaluation for the `measSIR` model, choosing the numbers of particles and replications so that your evaluation takes approximately one minute on your machine.
Provide a Monte Carlo standard error for your estimate. Comment on the bias of your estimate.
Optionally, take advantage of multiple cores on your computer to improve your estimate.

## Solution

```{r knitr-opts,include=FALSE,purl=FALSE}
source("../_includes/setup.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
```

First, we construct the model we've been exploring in the Lesson.

```{r model-construct}
library(tidyverse)
library(pomp)
set.seed(1221234211)
source("https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/pfilter/model.R")
```

Now, borrowing code from the notes, we run a few particle filtering operations.

```{r pfilter-loglik}
NP <- 10000
NREPS <- 10
timer <- system.time(
  pf <- replicate(
    NREPS,
    measSIR |> pfilter(Np=NP)
  )
)
ll <- sapply(pf,logLik)
logmeanexp(ll,se=TRUE)
```

This took `r round(timer["elapsed"],1)` seconds.

Since the time taken is approximately linear in `NP` and `NREPS`, we get a formula (for this machine) of
$$\mbox{Runtime}\approx \frac{ \mathrm{NP}}{`r NP`} \times \frac{\mathrm{NREPS}}{ `r NREPS`} \times `r mysignif(timer["elapsed"],2)`\mbox{sec}.$$

We can use this formula to select  `NP` and `NREPS` to give an appropriate runtime.

## Effects of `NP` and `NREPS` on estimates

Now, let us evaluate the dependence of log likelihood estimates on particle size and number of independent filters.
We first set up a parallel computation environment.

```{r parallel_setup,eval=FALSE,purl=FALSE}
library(doFuture)
library(iterators)
plan(multisession)
set.seed(594717807L)
```

```{r cluster,purl=FALSE,eval=FALSE,include=FALSE}
if (file.exists("CLUSTER.R")) {
  source("CLUSTER.R")
} else {
  library(doFuture)
}
```

```{r comps,eval=FALSE,purl=FALSE}
expand_grid(
  rep=1:1000,
  NP=c(1000,10000,100000)
) -> design

foreach (p=iter(design,"row"),
  .combine=rbind,
  .options.future=list(seed=TRUE)
) %dofuture%
  {
    library(pomp)
    measSIR |> pfilter(Np=p$NP) -> pf
    cbind(p,loglik=logLik(pf))
  } -> lls
```
```{r comps-eval,include=FALSE}
bake(file="loglikest-pfilter.rds",{
  <<cluster>>
  <<comps>>
  attr(lls,"ncpu") <- nbrOfWorkers()
  plan(sequential)
  lls
}) -> lls
```

We use violin plots to display the distributions of log likelihoods as they depend on `NP` and `NREPS`.

```{r plots}
expand_grid(
  NREPS=c(10,100,1000),
  lls
) |>
  filter(rep<=NREPS) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=NP,y=loglik,fill=ordered(NREPS),
    group=interaction(NREPS,NP)))+
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles=c(0.1,0.5,0.9),alpha=0.7)+
  scale_x_log10(breaks=unique(lls$NP))+
  labs(fill="NREPS",x="NP")
```

These plots reveal that one gets both more *precise* and more *accurate* estimates of the log likelihood by increasing the number of particles, `NP`.
That is, the variability in the estimates decreases with increasing `NP` (*precision*) and the bias decreases as well (*accuracy*).

On the other hand, increasing the number of independent filtering operations, `NREPS`, does not improve the picture much.
At best, we get a more accurate estimate of the variance.
In practice, however, a rough estimate of the precision is usually good enough.

## Considerations on combining log likelihood estimates and deriving standard errors

`logmeanexp` averages the replications on the untransformed scale, not the log scale.
It provides a standard error.

On the untransformed scale, the particle filter gives an unbiased likelihood estimate, so `logmeanexp` gives an asymptotically consistent estimate of the log likelihood as `NREPS` increases toward $\infty$.

Because the log function is concave down, [Jensen's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality) tells us that, as an estimate of the log likelihood, `logmeanexp` gives an estimate that is biased downward.

We can be quantitative about the bias via a Taylor series approximation.
Write the Monte Carlo likelihood estimate as $(1+\epsilon)\,\lik$, where the unbiasedness of the particle filter gives $\expect{\epsilon}=0$.
Then, if $\epsilon$ is small,
$$\log\big((1+\epsilon)\,\lik\big)\approx \log(\lik)+\epsilon-\epsilon^2/2,$$
and so the bias in the log likelihood estimate is approximately half its variance.

Let's examine the code for `logmeanexp`:

```{r logmeanexp,purl=FALSE}
logmeanexp
```

We see that `logmeanexp` constructs its standard errors via a [jack-knife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackknife_resampling) calculation.


The standard errors from this approach are reasonable when the distribution of the likelihoods is not too skewed.
However, a largest likelihood many log units higher than the others corresponds to a highly skewed distribution on the untransformed scale.
It is on this untransformed scale that combining likelihood estimates by averaging is justified by the unbiased property of the particle filter.
This could therefore lead to unstable standard errors. 

Let's consider an example for which we suppose that the Monte Carlo estimate of the log likelihood is normally distributed.
This assumption has asymptotic justification [@Berard2014].
We'll consider the two cases when the standard deviation on the log scale is given by `sd=1` and `sd=5`.

```{r test-plot,fig.dim=c(7,7),out.width="90%"}
sd1 <- replicate(10000,logmeanexp(rnorm(10,mean=0,sd=1),se=TRUE))
sd5 <- replicate(10000,logmeanexp(rnorm(10,mean=0,sd=5),se=TRUE))
m1 <- mean(sd1[1,])
t1 <- (sd1[1,]-m1)/sd1[2,]
m5 <- mean(sd5[1,])
t5 <- (sd5[1,]-m5)/sd5[2,]
x_range <- range(c(t1,t5))
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
par(mai=c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5))
hist(t1,breaks=50,xlim=x_range,main="Error in SE units, with sd=1")
abline(v=c(-2,2),col="red")
hist(t5,breaks=50,xlim=x_range,main="Error in SE units, with sd=5")
abline(v=c(-2,2),col="red")
```

The coverage of a simple $\pm 2$ standard error confidence interval for the log likelihood (represented by the vertical red lines in the figure at $\pm 2$ SE units) is `r mysignif(sum(abs(t1)<2)/length(t1)*100,3)` percent for the sd=1 case, but only `r mysignif(sum(abs(t5)<2)/length(t5)*100,3)` percent for the sd=5 case.

In particular, the left tail is long for the noisy likelihood estimates:
when, by chance, you don't observe a high likelihood value, you become over-confident that such values won't happen.

These results suggest that `logmeanexp` standard errors are reasonably reliable when the standard deviation of the individual log likelihood estimates is around one, but should be interpreted cautiously if that standard deviation is much larger.
