The course will have five components:

1\.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***A mandatory self-learning component***

- PDF versions of the lecture notes and slides
- Questions to `#mod07simulationinference` Slack channel

- On Slack: avoid unnecessary duplication!

--------------------

2\.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Exercises***

- Intended to consolidate and challenge your understanding of key concepts and methods
- Grapple with these Exercises on your own first
- The progress you make is less important than making a start at thinking about and working on the Exercise before the live session.

3\.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Live plenary discussions***

- Raise additional questions!
- Mute your audio and video at the start and keep muted until you have a question.

----------------------

4\.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Breakout-group sessions***

- Small groups work on the Exercises
- Breakout groups persist for the duration of the course.
- Within each breakout group, five roles
- ***Asking for help from a group***:
	a. post a question via Slack
	b. send a member out of the breakout room to ask
	c. leave the breakout room as a group
	d. use the 'Ask for Help' feature
- Do not hesitate to ask for help when needed!

------------------------------

5\.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Optional office hours***

- Drop in with questions or when you need help

-----------------------------

## Course Ground Rules

In the spirit of ensuring an efficient and enjoyable learning experience for everyone, ....

1. ***During live plenary discussions, turn on your audio and video only for questions***.

3. ***During the breakout discussions, keep both your audio and video on.***

4. ***Set your "name" in your Zoom session to what you want to be called***.

-----------------------------

## Course Ground Rules

5. ***Be on guard against distractions.***

6. ***Speak up!***

7. ***Be courteous.***

8. ***Dress comfortably, but professionally.***

9. ***Don't forget to laugh!***

-----------------------------

## Breakout Room Roles

- Designed to help the group function smoothly, and to make sure everyone in a group contributes to the group effort, and that every important task has someone to look after it.
- At the first breakout-group meeting:
    - Introduce yourselves
    - Decide who will perform each role to begin with
- Change the roles periodically, but not during a single session!
- None of these is a full-time job: 
everyone contributes toward the group's work, everyone listens to, everyone engages with, the contributions of the others

### Keeper

### Seeker
