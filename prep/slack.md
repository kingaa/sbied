Welcome to the SISMID Module 7 Slack channel!

We're looking forward to seeing you in our short course on "Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics"!

We sent some important information to you by an email. If you've read that, the following is redundant.
If you did not receive that message, please let us know by sending an email to kingaa.sismid@gmail.com.

Please go to https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/syllabus.html to see how the course will be structured, to view the schedule, and to get the assignments to be completed before the first session.

**It is important that you read through the syllabus at your first opportunity, so you will have time to prepare.  Do not put this off until the last day!**

The live activities will be held over Zoom.
**You must register first to be able to enter the Zoom session.**

We're anticipating a stimulating and enjoyable time.  See you soon!
