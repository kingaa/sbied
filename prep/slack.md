Welcome to the SISMID Module 14 Slack channel!

We're looking forward to seeing you in our short course on "Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics"!

We sent some important information to you by an email with subject line "SISMID Module 14 Advance Instructions". If you did not receive that message, please let us know by sending an email to kingaa.sismid@gmail.com.

We're anticipating a stimulating and enjoyable time.  See you soon!
