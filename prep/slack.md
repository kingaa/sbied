Welcome to the SISMID Module 7 Slack channel!

We're looking forward to seeing you in our short course on "Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics"!

We sent some important information to you by an email with subject line "SISMID Module 7 Advance Instructions". If you did not receive that message, please let us know by sending an email to kingaa.sismid@gmail.com.

We're anticipating a stimulating and enjoyable time.  See you soon!
