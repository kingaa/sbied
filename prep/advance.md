pagetitle: Advance Instructions for SISMID Module 7
---

Dear Module 7 Participant:

We are looking forward to seeing you online soon for our course on ***Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics***!
The course is fully subscribed and we are planning to fill the 2.5 days with both theoretical and practical material to help get you started using these exciting methods.

The schedule is quite full, so it is important that you take a little time beforehand to prepare yourself and your laptop.

**There are four important steps that you must take to prepare for the course.**

1. Install or update **R**, **Rstudio**, the **pomp** package and its dependencies, and the necessary compilers, on your laptop.
   You will need to have at least version 4.0.4 of **R** and at least version 1.4.1717 of **Rstudio** installed on your computer.
   **There will be no time for this during the 2.5-day workshop.**
   You should be aware that the *installation instructions depend on the operating system you use*.
   Make sure you follow these instructions *carefully* and *thoroughly*!
   Make sure you follow the instructions to *test* your system before you are finished!

	[The full installation instructions are here: follow them carefully!](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/prep/)

	Once you are finished, please fill out [this online form](https://forms.gle/NygBzhUzewTk7XBb6) to give us information about your computing system.

<div class="nb"> 
In previous years, some students have come to the workshop, only to find that they cannot use their laptops because they have not followed the instructions carefully.
It has been frustrating for them, and frustrating too for the rest of the class when we've wasted everyone's time troubleshooting the specific problems of one or two students.
**Don't be one of those people!**
Prepare your laptop, and follow the instructions to get help if you run into difficulties you cannot solve.

2. If you are unfamiliar with **R**, work through the [**R** tutorial](https://kingaa.github.io/R_Tutorial/).

3. Install [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download).
The course discussions will be held in Zoom sessions.

4. Install [Slack](https://slack.com/downloads).
This will be the side-channel for communication between instructors and participants and among participants during the course.

There will be no course materials in hardcopy: all the course materials are [available online](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/).

We are looking forward to seeing you in the course!
