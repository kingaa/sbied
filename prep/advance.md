Dear Module 14 Participant:

We are looking forward to seeing you in Seattle soon for our course on ***Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics***!
The course is fully subscribed and we are planning to fill the 2.5 days with both theoretical and practical material to help get you started using these exciting methods.

The schedule is quite full, so it is important that you take a little time beforehand to prepare yourself and your laptop.

**There are two things to do to prepare for the course.**

1. Install or update **R**, **Rstudio**, the **pomp** package and its dependencies, and the necessary compilers, on your laptop.
   You will need to have at least version 4.2.0 of **R** and an up-to-date version of **Rstudio** installed on your computer.
   **There will be no time for this during the 2.5-day workshop.**
   You should be aware that the *installation instructions depend on the operating system you use*.
   Make sure you follow these instructions *carefully* and *thoroughly*!
   Make sure you follow the instructions to *test* your system before you are finished!

	[The full installation instructions are here: follow them carefully!](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/prep/)

	Once you are finished, please fill out [this online form](https://forms.gle/xhCQ2mGWZoVcm7n18) to give us information about your computing system.

<div class="nb"> 
Long ago, some students came to the workshop, only to find that they could not use their laptops because they had not followed these instructions carefully.
It was frustrating for them, and frustrating too for the rest of the class when everyone's time was wasted troubleshooting the specific problems of one or two students.
**Donâ€™t be one of those people!**
Prepare your laptop, and follow the instructions to get help if you run into difficulties you cannot solve.

2. If you are unfamiliar with **R**, work through the [**R** tutorial](https://kingaa.github.io/R_Tutorial/).

There will be no course materials in hardcopy: all the course materials are [available online](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/).

We're looking forward to a stimulating and enjoyable time next week.  See you then!

Aaron, Ed, and Jesse
