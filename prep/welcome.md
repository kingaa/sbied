Dear SISMID Module 7 Participant:

We're looking forward to seeing you in our short course on "Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics"!

We have some important information for you in advance of the first session on 15 July.

Please go to https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/syllabus.html to see how the course will be structured, to view the schedule, and to get the assignments to be completed before the first session.

**It is important that you read through the syllabus at your first opportunity, so you will have time to prepare.  Do not put this off until the last day!**

The live activities will be held over Zoom.
**You must register first to be able to enter the Zoom session.**
The link for registration is: 
https://umich.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEsceCurTwvGdz-yyCDgStyDgGW3ZuJ1V-j 
After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.

Our intention is to conduct most communication over Slack rather than email.  You will soon receive a notification inviting you to join the Slack workspace for the module.  If you do not receive this notification, please notify Aaron at kingaa.sismid@gmail.com.

We're anticipating a stimulating and enjoyable time next week.  See you then!

Aaron
