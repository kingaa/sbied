We're looking forward to seeing you in our short course on "Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics"!

We have some important information for you in advance of the first session on 12 July.

Please go to https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/syllabus.html to see how the course will be structured, to view the schedule, and to get the assignments to be completed before the first session.

**It is important that you read through the syllabus at your first opportunity, so you will have time to prepare.  Do not put this off until the last day!**

The live activities will be held over Zoom. **You must register first to be able to enter the Zoom session.** The link for registration is:
