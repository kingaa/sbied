<p>Dear Module 7 Participant:</p>
<p>We are looking forward to seeing you online soon for our course on <strong><em>Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics</em></strong>! The course is fully subscribed and we are planning to fill the 2.5 days with both theoretical and practical material to help get you started using these exciting methods.</p>
<p>The schedule is quite full, so it is important that you take a little time beforehand to prepare yourself and your laptop.</p>
<p><strong>There are five important steps that you must take to prepare for the course.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Install or update <strong>R</strong>, <strong>Rstudio</strong>, the <strong>pomp</strong> package and its dependencies, and the necessary compilers, on your laptop. You will need to have at least version 4.0.4 of <strong>R</strong> and at least version 1.4.1717 of <strong>Rstudio</strong> installed on your computer. <strong>There will be no time for this during the 2.5-day workshop.</strong> You should be aware that the <em>installation instructions depend on the operating system you use</em>. Make sure you follow these instructions <em>carefully</em> and <em>thoroughly</em>! Make sure you follow the instructions to <em>test</em> your system before you are finished!</p>
<p><a href="https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/prep/">The full installation instructions are here: follow them carefully!</a></p>
<p>Once you are finished, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/chqrQK1k1mVuauic7">this online form</a> to give us information about your computing system.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="nb">
<p>In previous years, some students have come to the workshop, only to find that they cannot use their laptops because they have not followed the instructions carefully. It has been frustrating for them, and frustrating too for the rest of the class when we’ve wasted everyone’s time troubleshooting the specific problems of one or two students. <strong>Don’t be one of those people!</strong> Prepare your laptop, and follow the instructions to get help if you run into difficulties you cannot solve.</p>
</div>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>If you are unfamiliar with <strong>R</strong>, work through the <a href="https://kingaa.github.io/R_Tutorial/"><strong>R</strong> tutorial</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Install <a href="https://zoom.us/download">Zoom</a>. The live activities will be held over Zoom. <strong>You must register first to be able to enter the Zoom session.</strong> The <a href="https://umich.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEsceCurTwvGdz-yyCDgStyDgGW3ZuJ1V-j">link for registration is here</a>. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>Install <a href="https://slack.com/downloads">Slack</a>. Our intention is to conduct most communication over Slack rather than email. If you have not already, you will soon receive a notification inviting you to join the Slack workspace for the module. If you do not receive this notification, please notify Aaron at <code>kingaa.sismid@gmail.com</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Please go to <a href="https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/syllabus.html">the syllabus</a> to see how the course will be structured, to view the schedule, and to get the assignments to be completed before the first session. <strong>It is important that you read through the syllabus at your first opportunity, so you will have time to prepare. Do not put this off until the last day!</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>There will be no course materials in hardcopy: all the course materials are <a href="https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/">available online</a>.</p>
<p>We’re anticipating a stimulating and enjoyable time next week. See you then!</p>
<p>Aaron, Ed, and Qianying</p>
