# Module 7: Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics
## Pre-test Questions

1. How did you hear about this module?
1. What do you hope to learn in this module?
1. Do you have a specific problem to which you think the techniques of the Simulation-based Inference module will apply? If so, please describe it briefly.
1. Please rate your level of experience as an **R** user, 1(novice)--5(have analyzed many datasets in R using various techniques)
1. Please rate your level of experience as an **R** programmer. 1(have not written R functions)--5(have contributed to R packages)
1. Please rate your level of experience with infectious disease dynamics. 1(new to infectious disease modeling)--5(have been working for years on topics involving dynamic modeling of diseases)
1. Please rate your level of experience with time series analysis. 1(don't know what an ARMA model is)--5(familiar at the level of an introductory semester-long time series course)
1. To the best of your ability, briefly describe the following concepts.
   It's OK to say that you don't know or aren't sure, if that's the case.
	(a) Markov process
	(f) Euler's method
	(b) particle filter
	(c) likelihood
	(d) profile likelihood
	(e) partially observed Markov process


## Post-test Questions

1. Recalling what you said in the pre-test, were you successful in learning what you hoped from this module?
1. If you indicated that you had a specific problem to which you thought the mod
ule's methods might apply, are you closer to understanding whether the methods will in fact apply?  If they do, do you see a path forward?
