## Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics<br>Course Materials

These are notes from a short course given by [Ed Ionides](https://ionides.github.io/) and [Aaron King](https://kinglab.eeb.lsa.umich.edu/king/) at the [Summer Institute in Statistics and Modeling in Infectious Diseases (SISMID)](https://sismid.uw.edu).
From the [main page](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/), links lead to pages on a number of specific topics, culminating in four case studies that exemplify the methods and raise key issues.
For each such page, there is a corresponding **R** script, which contains the codes needed to recapitulate the calculations.
This script is a starting point for students to follow, explore, and modify the analysis according to their own curiosity and interest.

----------------------------

### Required software

The codes require, at a minimum, [**R**](https://cran.r-project.org/) version 4.2 and [**pomp**](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/) version 5.2.
Windows users must also have the appropriate version of [**Rtools**](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed.
The `prep` directory contains scripts that will install other needed packages and test the user's installation.

The following **R** packages are needed to build the materials, but are not used *in* the materials:

- **revealjs**
- **diagram**
- **mapproj**

The `contacts` lesson requires [**panelPomp**](https://github.com/cbreto/panelPomp).
An installation script is provided there.

A [Github Action](https://github.com/kingaa/sbied/actions) checks that these installations and actions succeed on a variety of current and legacy platforms:

----------------------------

### Compilation

Full compilation of all the materials can be accomplished by running `make` in the root directory.
This requires substantial resources.
For this reason, the most expensive computations are archived using the facilities provided for the purpose in **pomp**.
Compilation with these archives in place requires much less time than does compilation from scratch.
The following gives an indication of the size of the archives and the time required for their computation on a linux cluster with 250&nbsp;cpus.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
options(digits=3,knitr.kable.NA="")

gettime <- function (path) {
  if (grepl(".rds",path)) {
    readRDS(path) |> attr("system.time") |> getElement(3)
  } else if (grepl(".rda",path)) {
    e <- new.env()
    load(path,envir=e)
    e$.system.time[3]
  } else {
    NA_real_
  }
}

list.files(pattern=r"{.+\.rd[as]$}",recursive=TRUE) |> 
  {\(x) data.frame(
          path=x,
          dir=dirname(x),
          file=basename(x),
          size=file.size(x)/2^10,
          time=sapply(x,gettime)/60
        )}() |>
         remove_rownames() |>
         as_tibble() -> dat

dat |>
  rename(directory=dir) |>
  group_by(directory) |>
  summarize(size.kB=sum(size),time.min=sum(time)) |>
  arrange(-time.min) -> datsum

datsum |>
  mutate(
    size.kB=round(size.kB,0),
    time.min=round(time.min,1)
  ) |>
  rename(`size (kB)`=size.kB,`time (min)`=time.min)
```

The archives amount to about `r round(sum(datsum$size.kB)/1024,0)`&nbsp;MB.
About `r datsum |> filter(grepl("polio",directory)) |> mutate(size.MB=size.kB/1024) |> pull(size.MB) |> sum() |> round(0)`&nbsp;MB of this is associated with the polio lesson, in which large amounts of redundant information are stored.

Full compilation, i.e., rebuilding the complete set of materials following deletion of all archives, requires about `r datsum |> pull(time.min) |> sum(15) |> round(0)`&nbsp;min on a 250-processor cluster.
Full compilation regenerates the complete set of archives.
A finishing compilation, i.e., rebuilding with all archives in place, but with the re-Making of all documents, requires about 12&nbsp;min on a 64-cpu workstation.
