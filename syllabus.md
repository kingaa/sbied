### Important Information

We hope that you have already followed the [instructions for preparing your computer for the course](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/prep/).
**If you have not yet done so, please do so at your first opportunity:**
if you run into difficulties, you will definitely want to have those ironed out *before* the course starts.

Note also that there are mandatory activities ***prior to each day's meeting***.
For example, make sure that you have watched the video lectures for Lessons 1 and 2 (linked from the course website) before we meet on 12 July.
See the schedule below for details.

-----------------------------

### Course Website and Zoom session

The course website is https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/.
All course materials can be found there.
These include links to Youtube lecture videos, copies of the lecture slides, lecture notes, **R** scripts containing codes used in the lectures, and supplementary material on various background topics or topics touched tangentially in the lectures.
Exercises are given in the lectures and can be found on the slides and in the notes.

### Course Organization

The course will have five components:

1. ***A mandatory self-learning component***, in which students are expected to watch and take notes on the pre-recorded lectures prior to the day's activities.
   Links to the videos can be found on the [course website](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/), along with PDF versions of the lecture notes and slides.
   For example, before our live plenary on Monday, 12 July, we expect students to have watched the Lesson 1 and Lesson 2 lecture videos.
   If you have any questions that come up while you are watching the videos, please pose these using the `#mod14_simulation-based_inference_2022` channel in the SISMID Slack workspace (`sismidworkspace.slack.com`).
   We will monitor this channel and attempt to answer all questions either via Slack, or in the live sessions.
   This use of Slack will allow you check whether your question has been asked previously, to avoid the kind of unnecessary duplication that makes it hard for everyone.

1. ***Exercises.***
   Each lesson includes exercises intended to consolidate and challenge your understanding of key concepts and methods.
   To get the most out of the course, you will have to grapple with these Exercises on your own as well as in a group.
   
1. ***Live plenary discussions***, during which instructors will elaborate important points raised in the lectures and address common questions posed over Slack.
   During these sessions, feel free to raise any additional questions that come up.
   We ask that you mute your audio and video at the start of each live plenary and keep them muted until you have a question.
   When you do have a question, by unmuting your audio and video, you will become visible and will be given the floor to ask your question.
   You may also use the "Raise Hand" feature to ask a question.

1. ***Breakout-group sessions***, in which each student will work in small groups, in breakout rooms, on the Exercises.
   There will be nine groups.
   Each group member will have one or more of five roles:
   these are described below.
   At the beginning of each group meeting, group members should introduce themselves, and groups should quickly decide who should perform each role.  
   Each group will be visited by an instructor once during each session according to the following schedule:
   
   - Groups 1--3: Minute 10--25
   - Groups 4--6: Minute 30--45
   - Groups 7--9: Minute 50--65
   
   That is, Groups 1--3 will be visited for 15min, 10 minutes into each session, Groups 4--6 will be visited at the 30-minute mark, etc.
   Outside of these times, the instructors will be answering questions posed over the Slack channel and responding to Zoom "Ask for Help" requests.  
   At the end of each breakout group session, a progress report should be submitted to the Slack channel.
   
1. ***Optional office hours.***
   These are times when you should feel free to drop in with questions or when you need help.

-----------------------------

-----------------------------

### Breakout Room Roles

Breakout groups will be assigned anew at each session.
The following roles are designed to help the group function smoothly, and to make sure everyone in a group contributes to the group effort, and that every important task has someone to look after it.
At the beginning of each breakout-group meeting, decide among yourselves who will perform each role.
None of these roles is a full-time job: 
everyone is expected to contribute thought and effort toward the group's work, 
and everyone is expected to listen to, and engage with, the contributions of the other group members.

1. **Keeper.** 
   The Keeper is responsible for keeping time, keeping track of the group's goals, and keeping the group focused and running smoothly and happily.
   It's only a happy group that does good work.
   As Keeper, pay attention to making sure everyone is getting their needs met, everyone is able to contribute, and that the group is not losing sight of its goals.
1. **Taker.** 
   The Taker takes notes on the group's activities.
   What questions are being addressed?
   What hypotheses formulated?
   What approaches tried?
   What results obtained?
   What questions arose?
   What answers were discovered?
   The Taker should strive for complete but very concise notes and will be responsible for making sure that every group member has access to them.
   The Taker might choose to create a shared online document (using Google docs, for example) for this purpose.
   The group may decide to allow all group members to edit such a document, but the Taker shall be responsible for making the first draft of the notes for each session.
1. **Seeker.** 
   The Seeker is tasked with looking for information to help answer group questions.
   A good Seeker has all the course materials at his or her fingertips and can rapidly share search results with the group.
1. **Hacker.** 
   All group members are expected to do hands-on work with the methods we are teaching.
   In any given group session, however, the Hacker will have prime responsibility for producing the definitive version of the group's codes and full responsibility for making sure that all group members have access to the definitive version at the end of each breakout-group session.
   Again, the group may decide to use a shared online document for this purpose.
   Since learning to write correct and efficient code is central to the course's goals, the Hacker should make sure that the group is fully involved in all the coding.
1. **Slacker.**
   The Slacker takes responsibility for monitoring the group's interface with the course Slack channel.
   In addition, the Slacker is responsible for preparing a pr&eacute;cis of the group's efforts and progress, to be passed, via the course Slack channel, to the instructors and the rest of the group at the end of the session.
   This should be at most a paragraph, focused on communicating the essentials only: 
   what exercises were tackled, what approaches taken, what progress made, what difficulties encountered.

In groups with more than five members there can be multiple Hackers and Seekers.

For groups that have only four members, the Slacker and Taker roles may be combined, as may the Seeker and Keeper.

For groups that have only three members, the Slacker, Taker, and Keeper roles may be combined into one.

### Course Ground Rules

In the spirit of ensuring an efficient and enjoyable learning experience for everyone, we establish the following specific rules to govern our conduct.

1. ***During live plenary discussions, turn on your audio and video only for questions***.
   Live plenary discussions will be held over Zoom.
   Please mute your audio and video *unless and until you have a question.* 
   If you have a question, unmute yourself and turn on your video: 
   this will act as a cue for us to recognize you.
   You can also use the "Raise Hand" feature.
   The "chat" feature will be disabled during the live discussion.
1. ***When submitting over Slack, take some care to avoid unnecessary duplication.***
   If someone has recently asked the same question, you can register your interest in having that question answered using the "add reaction" button, without having to restate the question.
1. ***During the breakout discussions, keep both your audio and video on as much as possible.***
   The breakout sessions will be where you apply the lessons you learn and discover where you want to ask additional questions.
   You will have a specific role in your group that your fellow group members will rely on you to perform.
   To facilitate full engagement, keep your video and audio on during these sessions whenever appropriate.
1. ***Set your "name" in your Zoom session to what you want to be called***.
   We will be able to view your name, as well as your face, when you ask a question, or when we visit you in a breakout room.
   Having your name set in this way will help us recognize you.
1. ***Be on guard against distractions.***
   During the time in which your audio and video are on, do your best to minimize distracting sounds and sights that might distract your colleagues.
   It is equally important that you recognize that the digital environment is full of its own distractions: 
   do your best to eliminate the distractions that will prevent you from getting the most out of this intensive 2.5-day course.
1. ***Speak up!***
   We are striving for free-flowing discussions during the live plenary and breakout discussions.
   These depend on your active participation!
   This course is for **you**: make the most of it by getting answers to your questions.
   Don't worry that others may think you are holding us back with your questions:
   we can guarantee that others will have the same question.
1. ***Be courteous.***
   We will strive to uphold a high standard of courtesy and professionalism among participants, including ourselves.
   Treat others with respect and the dignity to which they are entitled, and with which you expect others to treat you.
1. ***Dress comfortably, but professionally.***
   You will be visible to your colleagues and instructors.
1. ***Have a sense of humor!***
   In online courses, many things can go wrong.
   Let's be generous and tolerant toward one another, and always willing to laugh!
