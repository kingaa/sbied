## Sub-computations and their interdependencies

A scientific computation can be broken down into sub-computations, each of which depends on previous calculations.
We refer to the fact that calculation B depends on the results of a calculation A by saying that B is *downstream* of A or A is *upstream* of B.

As we develop a scientific computation, we often need to try various approaches, tweak algorithmic settings, and so on.
When we do so, we need of course to re-run the computation to see the new result.
This can be costly to the extent that the computation requires resources (time, money, and patience for example).
When a computation is expensive, therefore, it can be useful to store its results, so that one does not have to recompute them unnecessarily.
For example, suppose we are modifying a sub-computation B that depends on the results of the upstream calculation A.
Any modification we make to B will require us to re-run B, but it would be wasteful to also re-run A, since we already know the result of A.

The **pomp** package provides two tools to help in the caching of intermediate results:  
- `bake` stores a single **R** object, the result of a specified computation.  
- `stew` can store multiple **R** objects resulting from a specified computation.  
In addition to these, **pomp** provides `freeze`, which controls the pseudorandom number generator.

These functions also play a role in supporting *reproducibility*.
In particular, they allow one to store not only the results of a calculation, but also the code that generated the results.
We demonstrate them here.

The [manual page](https://kingaa.github.io/manuals/pomp/html/bake.html) gives a full description:

       )

## Caching with `bake`

In the following snippet, the results of a very simple calculation are stored in the file `result1.rds`.
In this example, `x` and `y` represent the results of an upstream calculation and `z` is the result of the calculation we which to cache.
```{r bake1}
x <- 3
y <- runif(2)
bake(file="result1.rds",{
  x+y
}) -> z
x; y; z
```

When we run the above snippet for the first time, `z` is computed according to the recipe given, and is then stored, in [**R**'s binary `.rds` format](#rds-and-rda-formats), in the file `result1.rds`.
[Note also that `bake` appears to have retained some information about the amount of time used in the computation; 
[see below for more on this](#stored-attributes).]

If we run the code again,
```{r bake2}
bake(file="result1.rds",{
  x+y
}) -> z
z
```
there is no re-computation of `z`.
Instead, `bake` notices that `result1.rds` exists and therefore opens and reads the file, returning the stored result.

What happens if an upstream quantity changes?
For example:
```{r bake3}
x <- 5
y <- runif(2)
bake(file="result1.rds",{
  x+y
}) -> z
x; y; z
```
Note that we no longer have `x+y==z`.
Since `z` depends on `x` and `y`, we must re-compute `z`.
To do so, we simply delete the file `result1.rds`:
```{r bake4}
file.remove("result1.rds")
bake(file="result1.rds",{
  x+y
}) -> z
x; y; z
```

Thus, one has to manage the dependencies between `bake` calls oneself.

```{r cleanup}
#| include: false
unlink("result1.rds")
rm(list=ls())
```

## Caching with `stew`

The `stew` function works just like `bake`, but it can store multiple **R** objects, each of which has a name.
To do so, it uses [**R**'s `.rda` file format](#rds-and-rda-formats).
For example, consider the following snippet of code.
```{r stew1}
x <- 5
y <- runif(2)
stew(file="result2.rda",{
  z <- x+y
  w <- rexp(1)
  z+w
})
x; y; z; w
```
The `ls` command allows us to see the names of all **R** objects that exist in our workspace:
```{r ls1}
ls()
```

Now, if we re-run the `stew` call:
```{r stew2}
stew(file="result2.rda",{
  z <- x+y
  w <- rexp(1)
  z+w
})
x; y; z; w
```
This just loads the values of `z` and `w` from the file into the workspace, as we can see from the following.
```{r stew3}
rm(x,y,z,w)
stew(file="result2.rda",{
  z <- x+y
  w <- rexp(1)
  z+w
})
ls()
```
In the above, the `rm` call removes the four variables named.
We see that the `stew` call has retrieved `z` and `w`, but not `x` and `y`.

Notice also that the result of the last line of code inside the `stew` call, since it is not stored in any named location, is not cached.

```{r cleanup2}
#| include: false
unlink("result2.rda")
```

## Controlling the random-number generator

Both `stew` and `bake` allow one to control the pseudorandom number generator (RNG) by fixing its seed.
For example, the last snippet above includes a call to `rexp`, which simulates a draw from an exponential random variable.
Ordinarily, each time `rexp` is called, it returns a different value.

Consider the following snippet.
```{r stew4a}
stew(file="result3.rda",seed=99,{
  w <- rexp(1)
})
w
```
Of course, if we call `stew` again, we will simply reload the result we just computed:
```{r stew4b}
stew(file="result3.rda",seed=99,{
  w <- rexp(1)
})
w
```
However, if we now delete the result file and re-run,
```{r stew4c}
file.remove("result3.rda")
stew(file="result3.rda",seed=99,{
  w <- rexp(1)
})
w
```
we get the same result.
The positive integer we pass to the `seed` argument sets the state of **R**'s built-in RNG so that subsequent calls to `rexp` (or any other random-deviate simulator) will produce the same values.
To prevent this from affecting calculations *outside* the `stew` call, `stew` restores the RNG to the state it was in just prior to the `stew` call.

The `bake` function has exactly the same feature.

Finally, if one wishes to control the RNG in this way, *without* doing any caching, one can make use of the `freeze` function provided by **pomp**.
For example, consider the following.
```{r freeze1}
rexp(1)
freeze(rexp(1),seed=34996)
rexp(1)
freeze(rexp(1),seed=34996)
rexp(1)
```

### Exercise

Verify the claim that `freeze` does not affect the RNG outside of its call.


```{r include=FALSE}
unlink("result3.rda")
```

## Serialized file formats in **R** {#rds-and-rda-formats}

**R** has two binary formats for storing general **R** objects.
The `.rds` format holds a single **R** object.
One reads and writes such files using `readRDS` and `saveRDS`, respectively.
The `.rda` format can hold multiple **R** objects.
The `load`, `attach`, and `save` commands allow one to work with such files.
See the **R** help pages for these functions for more information.

------------------

## Attributes stored by `bake` and `stew` {#stored-attributes}

`bake` stores information about the amount of time required for a computation in the file, as an attribute of the stored object.
In addition, if the RNG has been fixed (by means of the `seed` argument), then the value of `seed` is stored as another attribute.
