</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="reproducibility_tools_:_file">file</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the archive file in which the result will be stored or retrieved, as appropriate.
For <code>bake</code>, this will contain a single object and hence be an RDS file (extension &lsquo;rds&rsquo;);
for <code>stew</code>, this will contain one or more named objects and hence be an RDA file (extension &lsquo;rda&rsquo;).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="reproducibility_tools_:_expr">expr</code></td>
<td>
<p>Expression to be evaluated.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="reproducibility_tools_:_seed">seed</code>, <code id="reproducibility_tools_:_kind">kind</code>, <code id="reproducibility_tools_:_normal.kind">normal.kind</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional.
To set the state and of the RNG.
The default, <code>seed = NULL</code>, will not change the RNG state.
<code>seed</code> should be a single integer.
See <code>set.seed</code> for more information.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="reproducibility_tools_:_dependson">dependson</code></td>
<td>
<p>arbitrary <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> object (optional).
Variables on which the computation in <code>expr</code> depends.
A hash of these objects will be archived in <code>file</code>, along with the results of evaluation <code>expr</code>.
When <code>bake</code> or <code>stew</code> are called and <code>file</code> exists, the hash of these objects will be compared against the archived hash;
recomputation is forced when these do not match.
The dependencies should be specified as unquoted symbols:
use a list if there are multiple dependencies.
See the note below about avoiding using &lsquo;pomp&rsquo; objects as dependencies.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="reproducibility_tools_:_info">info</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical.
If <code>TRUE</code>, the &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; of the calculation are returned as a list.
In the case of <code>bake</code>, this list is the &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; attribute of the returned object.
In the case of <code>stew</code>, this list is a hidden object named &ldquo;.ingredients&rdquo;, located in the environment within which <code>stew</code> was called.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="reproducibility_tools_:_timing">timing</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical.
If <code>TRUE</code>, the time required for the computation is returned.
This is returned as the &ldquo;system.time&rdquo; attribute of the returned object.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="reproducibility_tools_:_dir">dir</code></td>
<td>
<p>Directory holding archive files;
by default, this is the current working directory.
This can also be set using the global option <code>pomp_archive_dir</code>.
If it does not exist, this directory will be created (with a message).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="reproducibility_tools_:_envir">envir</code></td>
<td>
<p>the <code>environment</code> in which <code>expr</code> is to
be evaluated.  May also be <code>NULL</code>, a list, a data frame,
a pairlist or an integer as specified to <code>sys.call</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="reproducibility_tools_:_enclos">enclos</code></td>
<td>
<p>Relevant when <code>envir</code> is a (pair)list or a data frame.
Specifies the enclosure, i.e., where <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> looks for objects not found
in <code>envir</code>.  This can be <code>NULL</code> (interpreted as the base
package environment, <code>baseenv()</code>) or an environment.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>On cooking shows, recipes requiring lengthy baking or stewing are prepared beforehand.
The <code>bake</code> and <code>stew</code> functions perform analogously:
an computation is performed and archived in a named file.
If the function is called again and the file is present, the computation is not executed.
Instead, the results are loaded from the archive.
Moreover, via their optional <code>seed</code> argument, <code>bake</code> and <code>stew</code> can control the pseudorandom-number generator (RNG) for greater reproducibility.
After the computation is finished, these functions restore the pre-existing RNG state to avoid side effects.
</p>
<p>The <code>freeze</code> function doesn't save results, but does set the RNG state to the specified value and restore it after the computation is complete.
</p>
<p>Both <code>bake</code> and <code>stew</code> first test to see whether <code>file</code> exists.
If it does, <code>bake</code> reads it using <code>readRDS</code> and returns the resulting object.
By contrast, <code>stew</code> loads the file using <code>load</code> and copies the objects it contains into the user's workspace (or the environment of the call to <code>stew</code>).
</p>
<p>If <code>file</code> does not exist, then both <code>bake</code> and <code>stew</code> evaluate the expression <code>expr</code>;
they differ in the results that they save.
<code>bake</code> saves the value of the evaluated expression to <code>file</code> as a single object.
The name of that object is not saved.
By contrast, <code>stew</code> creates a local environment within which <code>expr</code> is evaluated; all objects in that environment are saved (by name) in <code>file</code>.
<code>bake</code> and <code>stew</code> also store information about the code executed, the dependencies, and the state of the random-number generator (if the latter is controlled) in the archive file.
Re-computation is triggered if any of these things change.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>bake</code> returns the value of the evaluated expression <code>expr</code>.
Other objects created in the evaluation of <code>expr</code> are discarded along with the temporary, local environment created for the evaluation.
</p>
<p>The latter behavior differs from that of <code>stew</code>, which returns the names of the objects created during the evaluation of <code>expr</code>.
After <code>stew</code> completes, these objects are copied into the environment in which <code>stew</code> was called.
</p>
<p><code>freeze</code> returns the value of evaluated expression <code>expr</code>.
However, <code>freeze</code> evaluates <code>expr</code> within the parent environment, so other objects created in the evaluation of <code>expr</code> will therefore exist after <code>freeze</code> completes.
</p>
<p><code>bake</code> and <code>stew</code> store information about the code executed, the dependencies, and the state of the random-number generator in the archive file.
In the case of <code>bake</code>, this is recorded in the &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; attribute (<code>attr(.,"ingredients")</code>);
in the <code>stew</code> case, this is recorded in an object, &ldquo;.ingredients&rdquo;, in the archive.
This information is returned only if <code>info=TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>The time required for execution is also recorded.
<code>bake</code> stores this in the &ldquo;system.time&rdquo; attribute of the archived <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> object;
<code>stew</code> does so in a hidden variable named <code>.system.time</code>.
The timing is obtained using <code>system.time</code>.
</p>


<h3>Avoid using &lsquo;pomp&rsquo; objects as dependencies</h3>

<p>Note that when a &lsquo;pomp&rsquo; object is built with one or more C snippets, the resulting code is &ldquo;salted&rdquo; with a random element to prevent collisions in parallel computations.
As a result, two such &lsquo;pomp&rsquo; objects will never match perfectly, even if the codes and data used to construct them are identical.
Therefore, avoid using &lsquo;pomp&rsquo; objects as dependencies in <code>bake</code> and <code>stew</code>.
</p>


<h3>Compatibility with older versions</h3>

<p>With <span class="pkg">pomp</span> version 3.4.4.2, the behavior of <code>bake</code> and <code>stew</code> changed.
In particular, older versions did no dependency checking, and did not check to see whether <code>expr</code> had changed.
Accordingly, the archive files written by older versions have a format that is not compatible with the newer ones.
When an archive file in the old format is encountered, it will be updated to the new format, with a warning message.
<strong>Note that this will overwrite existing archive files!</strong>
However, there will be no loss of information.
